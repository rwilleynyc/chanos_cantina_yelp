# Using Machine Learning to Help Small Businesses
If there is one thing businesses are learning, it's that proper data analytics isn't enough to gain a competetive edge, but has become a necessary ticket to compete. Sadly, many small businesses have neither the resources nor the know-how to take advantage of what data is available to them. With this project, the aim is to build a machine learning algorithm that can help any small business get a better sense of how they are presenting themselves to customers, who their direct competitors are, and how they compare to those competitors.
